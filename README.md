# [Google Fiber Business Intelligence Project](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleFiberDashboard_16873889664000/Presentation?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
> This project was part of the [Google Business Intelligence Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/7W8QFGV99NC7) with Coursera, specifically utilizing Big Query to exract data and Tableau for visualization. This end-of-course project was designed to apply skills in a workplace scenario from project planning to execution.

- Project goal is to explore trends in repeat callers, providing insights into call volume, types of customer issues, and trends across different market cities. This is to eventually plan how to reduce call volume, increase customer satisfaction, and improve operational optimization, with stakeholders having access to all datasets and accessible dashboards. Here is a link to the [documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GUjI2xpQ4PStALbQzIjD8kc5O2MRo3qh?usp=sharing).
- Some insights from the analysis showed that first calls were mostly for Tech Troubleshooting and Internet and Wifi issues. However, across majority of the markets, repeat calls were for Internet and Wifi issues, which presents an opportunity for improvement for Google Fiber.

# [Analytics Report on Analyzing Customer Churn](https://github.com/audreyanne96/Hult-MBAN-Projects/tree/main/Python/Analyzing%20Customer%20Churn)
> This was a team project as part of the MBAN program at Hult, specifically utilizing Python and machine learning to predict customer churn. As such, due credit goes to my teammates as well: Pablo Guala, Maria Turbi, Artyom Blazko, Ayowole Delegab, and Cedric Sollie.

- The Marketing Department is undertaking a comprehensive analysis to identify the key factors influencing customer retention, including personal characteristics, subscription type, and services offered. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn, enabling targeted customer engagement and the formulation of effective strategies to achieve the optimal product-market fit.
- The ability to predict customer churn is crucial for managing engagement terms and costs, as well as improving overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- In pursuit of this goal, the project explored various predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. After rigorous testing and tuning, the Random Forest Classification model exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a remarkable F1-score of 0.90, an AUC of 0.9271, and 94% accuracy in predicting churn.

- By implementing these recommended actions, the Marketing Department aims to reduce churn rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize business performance. The insights gained from this analysis will guide data-driven decision-making, fostering stronger customer relationships and driving sustainable growth in the organization.
