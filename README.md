- A European sports clothes company seeks to expand its market presence beyond Europe and Central Asia. The company aims to identify potential regions and markets for its products and the most effective product types to establish brand recognition in those areas.

- For the North American market, California was the state with the most activity. Here, the most in-demand products are sports apparel, fan apparel for various sports teams, and golf apparel for women. The company should position its prices similarly to its competitors in the market.
