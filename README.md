# [Analytics Report on Expansion for European Sports Brand](https://github.com/audreyanne96/Hult-MBAN-Projects/tree/main/Python/Expansion%20Analysis%20for%20European%20Sports%20Brand)
- As part of the MBAN program in Hult, we were tasked to do an in-depth consumer analysis on a hypothetical European Sports brand.
### Business Problem and Scope
- A European sports clothes company seeks to expand its market presence beyond Europe and Central Asia. The company aims to identify potential regions and markets for its products and the most effective product types to establish brand recognition in those areas.
- **Regional Market Research** - The ideal region and country should have a sizeable and stable potential market. A specific jurisdiction within the region should be identified as a starting point.
- **Product Strategy** - The company needs a distinct strategy to establish its brand in the target region, including identifying the type of products in demand or a gap in the local market that can be taken advantage of.
### Findings and insights
- The optimal regions for the company to expand to are North America and the Middle East & North Africa.
- The United States and Canada are the optimal countries to start the expansion in North America, while the UAE is the optimal starting point in the Middle East & North Africa.
- For the North American market, the most in-demand products are sports apparel, fan apparel for various sports teams, and golf apparel for women. The company should position its prices similarly to its competitors in the market.
- For the Middle East & North Africa market, the company should establish good relationships with existing platforms such as noon and Namshi, and focus on filling the gap for cotton/cotton blend sports and leisure apparel for women. The company should also position its prices similarly to its competitors in the market.
